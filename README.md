# Flowers
# Object oriented porgramming, inheritance, Java, GUI, Listeners, javax.swing, interfaces, abstract classes
This project draws 3 types of flowers on the jframe.
It asks user for total numbers of flowers to be drawn on the default 700X700 frame.
It randomly tries to draw all the flowers on the frame without overlapping them.
If all the flowers are not drawn but space is all fileed up it will stop to draw more.
If the frame is resized it will start drawing the remaining flowers on the frame.

Got the best implementation in class reward for this project.
